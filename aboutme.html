    <img src = "mom.jpg">
    <p class= "p">My name is Lucy Filler and I am a Junior at Piedmont High School, interested in Technology. I was born in San Francisco on August 11, 2005 and grew up in Piedmont, California with my parents and two older brothers. Some facts about me: I love to travel, try new foods, hang out with friends, and watch movies. I also enjoy challenging myself by learning about new topics and finding creative interests. When it comes to my family, my two older brothers are named Milo and Patrick, while also owning two cats, Pepper and Daisy. My brother studies Computer Science at his college and he always inspires me to learn more about technology. The goal of this website is to teach you all about the world of tech.</p>
