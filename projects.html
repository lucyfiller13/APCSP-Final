    <p class= "p"> This is a picture from my 8th grade graduation. Graduating middle school was definitely one of the biggest acomplishments in my life. I got through three difficult years of hard work to walk down the aisle and recieve my 8th grade diplmoma. Although middle school doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, I am still proud of myself for getting through it. Now, I am a Junior in high school, about to be a Senior, so hopefully next year, I can add a piecture of my high school diploma to this list.

    <p class= "p"> For my Action project for Honors English this year, my group and I decided to go into Hoover Elementary school in Oakland and help inspire younger students to see the opputunities that exist in the world. We first built marshmellow and pasta towers, to encourage their interest in STEM. The students loved this activity and many said that it helped them to realize that they want to be engineers in the future. On the second day visiting the school, we drew with the kids, helping them see the artisitc side of the world. This was an acomplishment for me because I built really strong relationships with intelligant and kind younger students and helped them to see the amazing future they can have.
